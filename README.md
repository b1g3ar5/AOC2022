Haskell solutions to the Advent of Code 2022

Particularly proud of Day21 which is the first time that I would have scored
and beaten J Paulson with the Newton Rapheson (that is if I had got up at 5am).

I had a lot of time that day so I reimplemented both solutions using hylomorphisms.
The first algebra does the usual operations, the second algebra does the inverse 
operations treating "humn" as a variable and then solves the resulting
problem in the "root" evaluation - also very neat.

Day23 - really slow 2 mins for part2
